1.Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

   * HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 are the two most widely used versions of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), 
     the foundation of the World Wide Web. HTTP/2 is a major update to HTTP/1.1 that offers a number of 
     performance improvements,including:

      Multiplexing:

           HTTP/2 can send multiple requests and responses over a single TCP connection, 
           which reduces the number of round trips required and improves performance.

      Header compression:

           HTTP/2 uses a more efficient header compression algorithm, which reduces the 
           size of HTTP messages and improves performance.

     Server push:

           HTTP/2 allows the server to push resources to the client before the client requests them,
           which can reduce the number of requests required and improve performance.


     The benefits of HTTP/2 include:


             Improved performance:
                   
                    HTTP/2 can significantly improve the performance of websites and web applications.
             
             Reduced bandwidth usage:

                   HTTP/2 can reduce the amount of bandwidth required to load websites and web applications.
                   
             Improved security:

                    HTTP/2 uses a number of security features that can improve the security of websites and web applications.



             To speed up web performance, both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 compress HTTP messages to make them smaller.
             However, HTTP/2 uses a more advanced compression method called HPACK that eliminates redundant 
             information in HTTP header packets. This eliminates a few bytes from every HTTP packet.
