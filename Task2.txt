2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

    *Objects are one of the most important concepts in JavaScript. 
     They are used to store and organize data in a way that makes 
     it easy to access and manipulate.

    *An object is a collection of properties. Properties are pairs of
     names and values. The name is the key to the value. You can access 
     a value by using the name of the property.

         const mybike = {
              make: "pulsar",
              model: "150",
              year: "2001",
            };
